# Email_send_django_tutorial

Django comes with a ready and easy-to-use light engine to send e-mail. Similar to Python you just need an import of smtplib. In Django you just need to import django.core.mail. To start sending e-mail, edit your project settings.py file and set the following options −

EMAIL_HOST − smtp server.

EMAIL_HOST_USER − Login credential for the smtp server.

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD − Password credential for the smtp server.

EMAIL_PORT − smtp server port.

EMAIL_USE_TLS or _SSL − True if secure connection
